<p>Goals: high priority</p>

<pre>The app shows me
  what ingredients I need to consume
  and how soon,
  and possible choices of cuisines with such ingredients.</pre>

<p>-medium priority</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">The</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">app</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">somehow</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">manages</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">quantity</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">of</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">ingredients</span>
</pre>

<p>-low priority</p>

<pre>The app knows what season each ingredients are available and their prices.</pre>

<p>To achieve high priority, the app needs to be able to:</p>

<pre>prioritize ingredients
  know current date. -done
  know expiration date
    from the stock list : NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON
    otherwise by looking up database of ingredients -done
with ingredients in stock prioritized, : NOT DONE AT ALL
  show recipes that only require available ingredients
  show recipes that require additional ingredients,
    and what ingredients they require
has databases of
  available ingredients -done
  recipes : NOT DONE AT ALL
    high priority: required ingredients
    low priority: the cooking process
  general knowledge about ingredients
    high priority: how fast the ingredient expires -done
    medium priority: available seasons
    low priority: prices of the ingredient depending on seasons</pre>

<p>I wonder: Maybe I should keep the list of KI sorted, and sort AI.list when
performing search, both alphabetically, to avoid searching from the top of
the database every time.</p>

<p>I want a program that churns out recipes based on the ingredients I have,
and tells me shoping list</p>

<p>I want the program to consider</p>

<pre>what ingredients are available at the time
cost of the ingredients
cooking time
how fast each ingredient degrades
consuming all the ingredients before they degrade
what kind of nutrients I get from each meal, and</pre>

<p>all the meals from the week</p>

<p>to do that I need a databases for</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">recipes</span>
<span class="ruby-identifier">ingredients</span>
</pre>

<p>and create instances of</p>

<pre>stuff I have
all the meals from the week
  to get the idea of necessary nutrients
list of recipes for the week
ingredients I need</pre>

<p>the program should be able to</p>

<pre>create recipes based on what I have and lack
  which means if I have nothing it still needs to be able to give something
emergency recipe for the day I have something I need to get rid of
adding recipes
adding ingredients
the program should know what ingredients I have left over, based on what I have and cooked</pre>

<p>at least it should be able to do the following:</p>

<pre>get a list of available ingredients and their amounts
show what I can cook just with those
show me the recipe that requires minimal shopping
how much leftover it gives
  and what I can cook with that up to a week0
  and if it leaves something to be thrown away</pre>
