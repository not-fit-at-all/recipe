Goals:
high priority
  The app shows me
    what ingredients I need to consume
    and how soon,
    and possible choices of cuisines with such ingredients.

-medium priority
  The app somehow manages quantity of ingredients

-low priority
  The app knows what season each ingredients are available and their prices.



To achieve high priority, the app needs to be able to:
  prioritize ingredients
    know current date. -done
    know expiration date
      from the stock list : NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON
      otherwise by looking up database of ingredients -done
  with ingredients in stock prioritized, : NOT DONE AT ALL
    show recipes that only require available ingredients
    show recipes that require additional ingredients,
      and what ingredients they require
  has databases of
    available ingredients -done
    recipes : NOT DONE AT ALL
      high priority: required ingredients
      low priority: the cooking process
    general knowledge about ingredients
      high priority: how fast the ingredient expires -done
      medium priority: available seasons
      low priority: prices of the ingredient depending on seasons




I wonder:
Maybe I should keep the list of KI sorted, and sort AI.list when performing search,
both alphabetically, to avoid searching from the top of the database every time.






I want a program that
churns out recipes based on the ingredients I have, and tells me shoping list

I want the program to consider
  what ingredients are available at the time
  cost of the ingredients
  cooking time
  how fast each ingredient degrades
  consuming all the ingredients before they degrade
  what kind of nutrients I get from each meal, and
all the meals from the week

to do that I need a databases for
  recipes
  ingredients

and create instances of
  stuff I have
  all the meals from the week
    to get the idea of necessary nutrients
  list of recipes for the week
  ingredients I need


the program should be able to
  create recipes based on what I have and lack
    which means if I have nothing it still needs to be able to give something
  emergency recipe for the day I have something I need to get rid of
  adding recipes
  adding ingredients
  the program should know what ingredients I have left over, based on what I have and cooked



at least it should be able to do the following:
  get a list of available ingredients and their amounts
  show what I can cook just with those
  show me the recipe that requires minimal shopping
  how much leftover it gives
    and what I can cook with that up to a week0
    and if it leaves something to be thrown away
